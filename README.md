# Hi there, I'm rpgyumyum! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a young software engineer who uses Arch Linux, btw. I'm also a passionate communist. ðŸš©

## About Me

I have a love for programming and exploring the world of technology. Currently, I'm focused on honing my skills in C++ and Linux. I enjoy diving into the command line, tinkering with various tools, and learning new concepts.

## Projects

- [ToDo-Terminal](https://github.com/rpgyumyum/ToDo-Terminal): ToDo command line application.
- [weather-Terminal](https://github.com/rpgyumyum/weather-Terminal): Command line weather app.

Please note that these projects are personal endeavors and may not represent my best work. I'm constantly learning and striving to improve my skills.
